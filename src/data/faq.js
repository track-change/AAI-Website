            question: "Do I have to be Asian American to exhibit or participate in Asian Arts Initiative?",
            answer: "We define Asian America expansively, not exclusively. Anyone who identifies as a part of the Asian diaspora counts. We also invite anyone working in or within proximity of Asian American communities and our various issues. The Initiative was founded as an interracial coalition of Black and Asian American poets working together to respond to community issues through an arts lens, and we continue to believe in art strategies that center all of our voices."
        }, {
            question: "What kind of art do you exhibit?",
            answer: "As a multi-disciplinary producer, presenter and anchor organization, our definition of art is open and questioning. We support artists in every facet of their workâ€”whether it is to provide space to practice, perform or exhibit art, to sponsor the production of it, or just to let you know what we think of it. We strive to serve the Philadelphia arts community, and courageous work in emerging and emergent stages. We hold open calls for visual and performance art, community based projects, on a thematically seasonal basis."
        }, {
            question: "How do you select artists?",
