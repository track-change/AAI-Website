      THE EROTIC PROJECT is an ongoing collaborative multimedia art project
      created in Philadelphia in early 2020 during quarantine inside the bedroom
      of artist Aubrié Costello. The project explores inclusive, accessible
      eroticism as mutual care for our holistic healing, and has grown into a
      collective of 40+ artists from Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Portland, +
      Mexico City.

    <p>
      THE EROTIC PROJECT approaches eroticism through the exploration of a vast,
      varied, & nuanced spectrum of where it can be found & experienced– within
      art, food, travel, work, self care rituals, personal practice, passions,
      identity, sex, sexuality, and in any moment which inspires & offers peace,
      pleasure, catharsis, joy, rest, space, freedom, and a deeper understanding
      of self & of the human experience.
