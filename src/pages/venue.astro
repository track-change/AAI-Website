            Located in Philadelphia’s burgeoning Chinatown North neighborhood,
            Asian Arts Initiative is a multidisciplinary arts center where all
            people — across experience and skill levels, age, race, and class
            backgrounds — can view and create art that reflects our lives, as
            well as think critically and creatively about the future we want to
            build for our communities. 
            <br> <br> 
            Our multi-tenant arts facility, built in
            1906, first served as a film screening and storage house for
            Duquesne Amusement & Supply Co (owned by the three eldest of the
            Warner Brothers), before later being converted into a medical supply
            depot for the Great Influenza epidemic of 1918-20. With a storied
            history throughout the 20th Century, today it serves as a resource
            for the broader cultural community, with individual artist studios
            as well as organizational and program space — including room for
            workshops and meetings; gallery and exhibition areas; and a
            black-box-style theater. Our building community is comprised of
            long-term and short-term tenants: mission-aligned service and arts
            organizations, artists, community groups, and more.
