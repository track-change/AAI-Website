### Oct 17th, Meeting 
- from the client: 
Website Questions:
PROGRAMS
1. Are we adding a “Related” pages option at the bottom, to link to relevant programs/exhibits? (also in Artist Directory)
2. What’s the difference between adding a name under “Curator” (not currently showing up on display) and adding a curator as a “Front Caption”?
3. How does the option to add images at the bottom work / show up on the page? 
Reorganization of Past Programs: just by year, not season? Search by event type (especially for music)?
